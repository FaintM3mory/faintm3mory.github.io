# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm FaintM3mory, a passionate cybersecurity rookie and student. Through this blog, I'm posting my challenge write-ups and projects to keep trace of my improvement.

Numerous people (and friends) that I follow online gave me the idea to create this blog in order to share my doings on different cyber practicing platforms such as [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/FaintM3mory) or other websites. This aims to be helpful for both my older self who would want to remind himself of a few tricks and for other people who are going through the same challenges.
