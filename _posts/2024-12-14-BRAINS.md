# Red : Exploit the Server !

## Reconnaissance

As always, we start with a nmap scan :

```shell
nmap -T4 -n -sC -sV -Pn -p- $TARGET > nmap.txt
 
 cat nmap.txt

We can directly see the **Apache** server on **port 80**, a **SSH** server, a **Java RMI** port and an **IBM-db2** port.

Here is what we see when we access the port 80 on the browser :

![web app](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/1.png)

For now, nothing to see so I decide to launch a **gobuster scan** to enumerate any directories on the website :

```shell
~ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.73.88/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 30

```

But nothing found!

So, we connect to the port **50000** with the hope of finding something interesting and we stumble onto a login form to log in **TeamCity** :

![teamcity](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/2.png)

**TeamCity** is a building management and continuous integration server from JetBrains.

Considering this, I try a few time to log in with common usernames to see if it recognizes one but it doesn't work.

Eventually, I launch **Metasploit** and search for exploits available on TeamCity and there is an *excellent* one released in 2024 which allows **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution**.

![searchsploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/3.png)

## Initial Access

So I use this payload, fill in the different options and start the exploit to let the magic happen.

![metasploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/4.png)

I manage to get a shell with the **ubuntu** user.

Before going any further, I [upgrade my shell](https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/) for more convenience.

Once that done, I directly head into the `/home` folder of the user I am controlling and retrieve the first flag.

![firstflag](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/5.png)

During my searches, I also found another way of exploiting TeamCity which is not *automatic*, [this website explains in details how it is vulnerable](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/03/04/etr-cve-2024-27198-and-cve-2024-27199-jetbrains-teamcity-multiple-authentication-bypass-vulnerabilities-fixed/).

Now let's move on to the second part !

# Blue : Let's investigate

After arriving on the Splunk *Search & Reporting* dashboard, we retrieve a few thousands of logs to investigate.

Our first thing to search is the *name of the backdoor user which was created on the server after exploitation*, so we can type the `shell` keyword in the search bar and figure out if any user was created with `/bin/bash` shell. 
There is one ! (Later in the logs, we notice that the operation failed) :

![backdooruser](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/6.png)

Hence, we need to find the *name of the malicious-looking package installed on the server*. 
In order to check the packages, we can specify the source to `/var/log/dpkg.log` to track the installation of the packages.
After that, if we look at the period when the **backdoor user** was created, we can find the package that was installed (indeed its name is suspicious).

![weirdpackage](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/brains/7.png)

Then, to get the *name of the plugin installed on the server after successful exploitation*, we just need to search among the few logs left when we set the time range on **the day the exploitation occured**.
